multimodal-framework

Repository for developing a multimodal gesture classification system.
Very much WIP at this stage and will remain so for a long while.
Primary development branch. Whilst attempts are made to ensure "complete" packaged of work get pushed to the branch, zero guarantees are made that the code here will be complete or working at any given point in time. As and when significant, working updates are ready main branch will be updated accordingly.
